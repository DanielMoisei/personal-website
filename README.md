This project uses a mix of React and SCSS to deliver an immersive and interactive experience.
It allows you to:
- Navigate through different projects and play around with them
- Change between a light and dark theme on demand, or use the default theme the app selects for you based on the time of day
- Quickly get in touch with me through an e-mail
- Get to know who I am and get an idea of what I can do

Note: The projects included here haven't been improved on from the moment I finished working on them. This means they are in the state that my experience and skill allowed to at the time when I built them, and don't fully reflect everything I've learned since then.
